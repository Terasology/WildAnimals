Module for wild animals:

It is intended to be used as dependency and not as a standalone content module. 
The idea is that content modules can decide on the rules when and where to spawn the wild animals.

It contains so far only an deer with a very simple AI.

The deer can be spawned with "spawnPrefab deer".
